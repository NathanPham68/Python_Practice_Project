# üß† Beginner Python Practice

Welcome to this beginner-friendly Python exercise repository!
This project is designed to help you strengthen your core programming skills by working through small but meaningful problems. These tasks cover essential Python topics including:

- Lists

- Strings

- Dictionaries

- Tuples

- Loops & Conditions

- Functions

- Input/Output

- Basic algorithmic thinking

Whether you're just starting out or reviewing the basics, this project is for you!

üéØ **Project Goals**

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Manipulate and transform data using lists, dictionaries, and tuples

- Write reusable functions

- Practice looping, conditional logic, and string manipulation

- Apply real-world thinking to common problem patterns

- Improve your understanding of Python syntax and logic step by step

üß† **Problem-Solving Mindset (Step-by-Step Guide)**

Each exercise follows a logical approach that you can use when solving any Python problem:

1. Read & Understand the Problem
‚Üí Identify the goal, keywords, and the expected input/output

2. Clarify Input and Output
‚Üí Know the required data type and format clearly

3. Sketch a Quick Plan
‚Üí Outline your solution idea briefly

4. Link Back to What You've Learned
‚Üí Map your plan to Python knowledge: loops, conditions, etc.

5. Break Down the Problem
‚Üí Think in smaller steps:

    - Looping through data

    - Checking conditions

    - Updating variables or collections

6. Write a Function Skeleton
‚Üí Example: def function_name(params): ...

7. Implement Step-by-Step Logic
‚Üí Code exactly what you planned using loop ‚Üí condition ‚Üí update flow

8. Test with Sample Inputs
‚Üí Compare actual output with the expected one

9. Refactor if Needed
‚Üí Improve readability, fix bugs, or optimize performance

## üìç Exercise 4: Write a program to accept a string from the user and display characters that are present at an odd index number. 

For example, str = "unigap" so you should display 'n', 'g', 'p'. 

* Code

```ruby
# accept input string from a user
word = input('Enter word: ')
print("Original String:", word)

# get the length of a string
size = len(word)

# iterate a each character of a string
# start: 0 to start with first character

# step: 2 to get the characters present at odd index like 1, 3, 5
print("Printing only even index chars")
for i in range(1, size, 2):
    print("index[",i,"]", word[i])
```

## üîÅ Exercise 5: Reverse a given integer number 

Given: 65869

* Code

```ruby
num = int(input('Given Number: '))
reverse_number = 0
while num > 0:
    reminder = num % 10
    reverse_number = (reverse_number * 10) + reminder
    num = num // 10
print("Reverse Number:", reverse_number)
```

## ‚ûï Exercise 6: Calculate the sum of all numbers from 5 to a given number

Write a program to accept a number from a user and calculate the sum of all numbers from 5 to a given number.

For example, if the user entered 10 the output should be equal 5+6+7+8+9+10 = 45

* Code

```ruby
# s: store sum of all numbers
s = 0
n = int(input("Enter number "))
# run loop n times
# stop: n+1 (because range never include stop number in result)
for i in range(5, n + 1, 1):
    # add current number to sum variable
    s += i
print("\n")
print("Sum is: ", s)
```

* Results

For example, suppose the taxable income is 45000 the income tax payable is

10000x0% + 10000x10% + 25000x20% = $6000.

* Code

```ruby
income = 45000
tax_payable = 0
print("Given income", income)

if income <= 10000:
    tax_payable = 0
elif income <= 20000:
    # no tax on first 10,000
    x = income - 10000
    # 10% tax
    tax_payable = x * 10 / 100
else:
    # first 10,000
    tax_payable = 0

    # next 10,000 10% tax
    tax_payable = 10000 * 10 / 100

    # remaining 20%tax
    tax_payable += (income - 20000) * 20 / 100

print("Total tax to pay is", tax_payable)
```

* Results

    sqr_tuple = tuple(sqr_list)
    return sqr_tuple
sqr_tuple((1,2,3,4))

    even_num = 0
    for i in a:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even_num += 1
